This is a test project to research whether SDRVM can listen to two or more RTL-SDR dongles on Raspberry Pi 4b. The project is based on @cemaxecuter's code regarding MQTT and Whipser.

The project is trying to moniter multiple frequency with  mulitple RTL-SDR, record the audio when trigger is met, then send out the audio file path via MQTT. 

Current issues:
   * Rarely occasion: Segmentation Fault. Not sure what the trigger is.


Pre-requisite:
   * DragonOS Raspberry Pi - DragonOS_Pi64_Beta30
   * RTL-SDR dongles x 2

How to setup:
   1. Reset serial for RTL-SDR.
       * Only plug-in 1 RTL-SDR at a time
       * Use 'SoapySDRUtil --find' to check the current serial of the dongle

      * Modify the dongle serial with 'rtl_eeprom -s <new_serial>'
      * Once success, disconnect and reconnect the dongle and check with 'SoapySDRUtil --find'
      * Repeat the processes for the other dongles, ensure each dongle has unique dongle and record all of them

   2. Currently all the files on my rp4 are located under '/usr/src/SDR4space/DragonOS/RX/DDC_whisper', but should work anywhere

   3. Before start, check 'settings_remote_multi.js', make sure all "serial_no=" is filled with dongles serial numbers just set.

   4. Run with 'sudo ./sdrvm -d DragonOS/RX/DDC_whisper/ -f DDC_MQTT_FM_remote_multi_whisper.js'
